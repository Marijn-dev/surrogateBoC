# Read me on the surrogate model for a BoC device

This repository contains three folders. One folder containing all the Matlab code, one folder for the python code and a folder on the Multi-Electrode-Array (MEA) data
The content of these folders and how to set up and use the code in this repository is described folder by folder below.

## Folder: MEA_data
The project data is too large to be stored directly on GitHub. However, the data remains accessible through **PhD Guillem Monso Garcia**.

### Where to Find the Data
To access the MEA data used in this project measured on 02-07-2024, permission needs to be asked for the path in Guillem's database:
9_Experiments -> Experiment Execution -> iNeurons -> D42

### Information on the measurements in this repository
In this repository an excel file is available that describe all the different stimulation characteristics that are applied for each measurement. This file is called '0209_log_measurement.xlsx'.
Additionally, some images are visible from device A. 

### Converting the Data
To convert the data, you will need the **Multichannel System Datamanager** software tool.
With this you are able to convert the raw data to '.h5' format which enable loading in the data in Matlab
You can download the software and follow the installation instructions from the official website:
